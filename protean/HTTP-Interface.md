# PSR-15 - HTTP Server Request Handlers
## Summary
This problem is identical to Dependency Injection for objects.  In this case, controllers do not provide the ability to arbitrarily inject logic to handle the abstraction of HTTP Messages (PSR-7). In addition, controllers couple our code to a particular framework.

## Specification
Use PSR-15 Server Request Handlers.
