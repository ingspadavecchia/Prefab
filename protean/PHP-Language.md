# Summary
The PHP langauge has improved a lot since PHP 7 was introduced, and some important improvements have also been made since then. This document describes some of the language features that we leverage and extend in order to accomplish the `Protean` architecture specification.

# Strict Typing
PHP 7 introduced [strict typing](http://php.net/manual/en/functions.arguments.php#functions.arguments.type-declaration.strict) and the ability for [return type declarations](http://php.net/manual/en/functions.returning-values.php#functions.returning-values.type-declaration) as well as continuing with the ability to use [argument type declarations](http://php.net/manual/en/functions.arguments.php#functions.arguments.type-declaration). 
* All methods MUST provide an argument or return type declaration. 
* All PHP files MUST `declare(strict_types=1);`
* Public methods MUST NOT declare an `array` primitive as an argument or return type declaration. See [Typed Arrays](#typed-arrays).

# Interfaces
All classes MUST have an Interface. 

# Typed Arrays
PHP 7 still does not have typed collections of objects. We have created the ability to have Typed Arrays of any arbitrary object and these MUST be code generated and MUST be used to pass object collections between public interfaces. Typed Arrays SHOULD also be used for internal storage and access inside an actor.

# Aware Traits
PHP has included [Traits since](http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.traits.php) `>=` `5.4.0`. We will use code generated Traits in singular, and very specific way. Aware Traits provide the ability to include getters and setters for `Object1` that can be included in other objects to make them aware of `Object1`.  Aware Traits MUST be code generated.  Aware Traits SHOULD be used as the method in which to acces other actors within in object.  There must be a sufficiently strong reason to use a hand written getter or setter for an external actor and that reason MUST be documented in the PR along with any considerations on how to avoid code duplication and tight coupling.

# Composition Over Inheritence
As with any sufficiently mature software project, all of the features have a time and place when they are appropriate to use.  However, all classes and interfaces SHOULD not use inheritence. There must be a sufficiently strong reason to inherit from an object, and that reason MUST be documented in the PR along with any considerations on how to decouple that object in the future.
