# Summary
[Dependency injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) implements the concept of [Inversion of Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control).

# Service Definitions
Service definitions tell the container what dependencies an object has.
* All service definitions MUST be generated by the Symfony PHPStorm plugin.
* All service definition files MUST only declare dependencies for a single class.
* All service definition files MUST NOT have more than one service per file.
* All service definition files MUST be named `<CLASS_NAME>.yml` and be at the same directory level as the target class.
* All service definitions MUST explicitly declare the `public` property value.
* All service definitions MUST explicitly declare the `shared` property value.
* All service definitions SHOULD NOT declare an `alias`. If an `alias` is necessary it MUST be noted in the PR why and how it will uphold the Neighborhoods Engineering Values.
* All service files SHOULD NOT use the `resource` declaration. If a `resource` declaration is necessary it MUST be noted in the PR why and how it will uphold the Neighborhoods Engineering Values.
