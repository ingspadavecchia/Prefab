# Summary
[Apache Velocity](http://velocity.apache.org/engine/1.7/user-guide.html) is a Java-based template engine. `PHPStorm` has first class support for using it to generate code. We are currently using this as a polyfill for a `PHP` code generation tool until one can be written.

# Purpose
The purpose of the `AVT`'s is to ensure the consistent creation of code that can and should be built by a machine.  These actors include but are not limited to the following:
* Factories
* Repositories
* Builders
* Aware Traits
* OpenAPI Specifications

# How To Contribute
In order to improve existing `AVT`'s or create new ones, please submit a PR to the `prefab` master repository branch.

# Usage
Please see the `README` in the `prefab` repository root.
