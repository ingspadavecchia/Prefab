# Summary
Testing a behavior of a part of code is an important part of being able to validate that the behavior is correct.  It is often difficult to setup these tests which is unattractive to engineers with deadlines.

# Specification
Use Continuous Test Driven Development (CTDD).  Test Contracts (~behaviors), and pass implementations as part of a data provider. Use a framework to simplify the creation of tests.
